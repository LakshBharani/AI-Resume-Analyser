Overview
Student Training in Engineering Program (STEP) is a developmental internship program for students in their first or second year of a Bachelor's degree program in Computer Science or a related field, aimed specifically at cultivating high potential students and focuses on providing development opportunities through technical training, software engineering project work, and professional development.

Google welcomes applications from candidates from all backgrounds regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, disability status or any other dimension of diversity, who are currently enrolled in a full-time Bachelors degree program.

Students from all schools, and students who (1) have demonstrated a commitment to diversity and inclusion; (2) have faced and overcome adversity; or (3) identify with a group that is historically underrepresented in the technology industry including, but not limited to Black, Hispanic, Native American, students with disabilities, Women and veterans, are encouraged to apply.

Program Goals
To provide interns with the opportunity to complete a challenging technical project where you will build solutions and gain exposure to immense scale and complexity.
To help interns develop their technical skills, build confidence in their abilities, and better prepare them for their future in computer science. All STEP interns will receive coaching and mentorship from Google engineers to guide you through your summer experience.
To give interns an inside look at Google's unique environment, community, and culture. Interns will have the opportunity to attend technical talks by Googlers, gain insight into technical interview preparation, learn about Googleâ€™s coding practices and technologies, and develop other skills that will set them up for success.
To help participants begin building important personal networks and friendships with a diverse group of students who share their passion for technology and computer science.
Eligibility Requirements
Minimum Qualifications

Completed first or second year of undergraduate studies in computer science or a related field by Summer 2025.
Programming experience in C++, Java, JavaScript or Python.
Have taken 1-2 college computer science courses (AP or IB included).

Preferred Qualifications

Returning to a Bachelor's degree program with at least two years remaining in their academic program after completion of the Summer 2025 internship.
Ability to complete a full-time, 12-week internship between May and August or June and September 2025 (exact program dates will be provided at a later point in the process).
